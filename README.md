THIS IS A BETTER EXPLANATION OF THE LIST OF REPOSITORIES

This is a collection of some of my coding work primarily over the last 2-3 years or so. Most of it is messy and undocumented, as almost all of it was personal projects to begin with. I unfortunately don't have time to properly document / update / fix everything right now.

The projects are primarily scattered across:
-Webscraping
-General data work
-Quantitative finance | research, analysis, visualization, simulation
-GIS mapping


Primary tools used throughout these projects are:
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Selenium
-Flask
-GIS
-Various APIs for data sources
